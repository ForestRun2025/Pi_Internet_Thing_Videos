# Raspberry Pi Internet Thing Videos 2.0 (Update)

This is an update to a series of videos and code created by Tony DiCola & Adafruit. Sadly, it seems like Mr. DiCola is no longer publishing code by his work really taught me a great deal and wanted to pass on the code with updates for others to learn.

Below are the links to his videos.  
Example code to go along with video series on building an internet 'thing' with a Raspberry Pi. Demonstrates building a web app in Python that controls the Pi hardware with a web interface.

In this repository I have made minor changes for code updates.
Python 3.10.x
Flask 2.1.x
JQuery 3.6.x
